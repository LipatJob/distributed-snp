Create a parallel and distributed implementation of the spiking neural p system using CUDA and MPI. See snp_explanation.tex to learn more about what Spiking Neural P Systems are. Assume that the SNP system is deterministic (so the inputs will create a deterministic SNP system). Each node has a T4 GPU. Assume that the input size is large. The system must distribute the work among different nodes to maximize performance. It must also minimize the communication between Processes, Processor <-> GPU, and GPU <-> Global Memory.
